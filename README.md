## 📌 **Live Site URL:** <a href="https://aimt-learned.netlify.app/">**Visit Now** 🚀</a>

Our Educational Website would provide all the education-related stuff:
Notes, Sample Papers, Online Video Lectures, and courses to crack competitive
exams like JEE-Main, JEE-Advanced, GATE, etc. Students can clear their doubts
by sending their questions to our website. We have added Quizzes for Students
who are willing to solve problems on different topics. We have also added
Interview questions for students who are preparing for placements.

✔ We have made this website as responsive website so, students or users can
easily access our website from any device.
✔ Quiz Section is an exciting feature for students, providing them with many questions. They can view their scores easily and solutions of every question.
✔ Projects – I have added a project section where students from schools and
colleges can get projects for the final year and for Class 12th Board Projects.

It is a completely responsive website, to provide a smooth experience...😎

If you like my project, give it a star 😁😁😁
